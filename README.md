## Waste Segregation Using Deep Learning Models
This project is a web application that performs waste segregation using deep learning models. It utilizes the VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception models for image classification to identify different types of waste. A comparative analysis was conducted to determine the model with the best accuracy, which is then used for the final implementation in the web application. The application allows users to upload images of waste, processes them through the selected model, and classifies the waste into categories.

# Features
- Conduct comparative analysis of VGG16, ResNet50, and Xception models to determine the best-performing model.
- Use the model with the highest accuracy for waste classification in the web application.
- Upload images of waste for classification.
- Display the classification results along with confidence scores.
